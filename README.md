######ImageGrabber Gallery

Welcome to ImageGrabber Gallery, a simple and rewarding project that allows you to create your very own image gallery with dynamic image fetching and display!
Overview

ImageGrabber Gallery is a web application built using Node.js and MongoDB to fetch and display images from a database on the frontend. It leverages the power of RESTful APIs to enable seamless communication between the backend and frontend, making it easy to access and display images from various platforms and devices.
Setup

Before diving into the project, ensure you have Visual Studio Code and Node.js installed on your system. Once you're set up, follow the steps outlined below to get started:

    Open Visual Studio Code and access the terminal.
    Install the necessary dependencies using npm i cors dotenv express nodemon mongodb mongoose.
    Create the required files and folders: "images" folder, "index.js" file, and ".env" file for handling environment variables.
    Set up your MongoDB database and connect it to the backend using Mongoose.

######How to Use

Once the setup is complete, your ImageGrabber Gallery is ready to roll! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use it:

    Start your server by running npm run start in the terminal.
    Make your first REST request to fetch all images using the /api/getAll endpoint.
    Verify the API endpoint functionality using Postman or your web browser.

#Displaying Images

To display the images on the frontend, follow these steps:

    Prepare your "public" folder and create an "index.html" and "script.js" file.
    Use the provided JavaScript code in "script.js" to fetch and dynamically display the images from the backend.
    Customize the styling and design of the gallery to match your preferences and theme.
